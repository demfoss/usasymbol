## Why Was the Violet Chosen?

The violet was chosen as Illinois' state flower through a vote by schoolchildren in 1908. This charming wildflower won the hearts of young voters with its delicate beauty and widespread presence throughout the state. The violet's ability to thrive in diverse conditions—from deep woodlands to sunny lawns—mirrors the resilience and adaptability of Illinois residents.

The selection of the violet reflected the progressive spirit of the early 20th century, when many states were establishing official symbols to celebrate their unique natural heritage. Illinois was among the first states to involve children in choosing a state symbol, setting a democratic precedent that many other states would follow.

## Physical Characteristics

### Flowers

Illinois violets produce distinctive five-petaled flowers that bloom profusely in spring. The most common color is a rich purple-blue, though white and bicolor varieties also occur naturally. Each flower features:

- **Lower petal**: Slightly larger with distinctive purple veining that guides pollinators
- **Side petals**: Often bearded with fine white hairs near the throat
- **Upper petals**: Typically solid colored and slightly reflexed

The flowers measure about 3/4 inch across and are held on slender stems that rise above the foliage. After the showy spring blooms fade, violets produce inconspicuous cleistogamous (self-pollinating) flowers throughout summer.

### Leaves

Violet leaves are heart-shaped (cordate) with scalloped edges and emerge directly from the ground on individual petioles. The leaves:
- Start small and unfurl as they grow
- Can reach 2-4 inches in width at maturity
- Have a slightly fuzzy texture
- Form attractive clumps that persist through fall

### Root System

Common blue violets spread by both seeds and underground rhizomes, allowing them to form colonies over time. This dual reproductive strategy ensures their survival and makes them excellent ground covers in appropriate settings.

## Growing Violets in Illinois

### Garden Applications

Violets make excellent additions to:
- **Woodland gardens**: Naturalize beautifully under trees
- **Rain gardens**: Tolerate periodic flooding
- **Lawn alternatives**: Create purple carpets in spring
- **Container gardens**: Grow well in pots and window boxes

### Care Requirements

While violets are notably low-maintenance, they perform best with:
- **Soil**: Rich, moist, well-draining soil with organic matter
- **Water**: Regular moisture during growing season
- **Light**: Partial shade optimal, tolerates full sun with adequate moisture
- **Fertilizer**: Light application of balanced fertilizer in spring

### Common Challenges

- **Aggressive spreading**: Can become weedy in formal gardens
- **Leaf spot diseases**: Occur in overly wet conditions
- **Slugs and snails**: May damage foliage in shady areas

## Cultural and Historical Significance

### Victorian Symbolism

In the Victorian language of flowers, violets represented:
- **Modesty and humility**
- **Faithfulness in love**
- **Spiritual wisdom**

Young women often wore violet corsages, and the flower appeared frequently in poetry and romantic correspondence of the era.

### Medicinal Heritage

Native Americans and early settlers used violets for various remedies:
- Tea from leaves and flowers for respiratory ailments
- Poultices for skin conditions
- Syrup for sore throats and coughs

Modern research has identified beneficial compounds including:
- Salicylic acid (anti-inflammatory)
- Mucilage (soothing properties)
- Vitamins A and C

### Culinary Uses

Violet flowers and leaves are edible and have been used in:
- **Candied violets**: Victorian cake decorations
- **Violet syrup**: Flavoring for beverages
- **Salads**: Young leaves add color and mild flavor
- **Herbal teas**: Gentle, soothing brews

## Conservation and Ecology

### Wildlife Value

Violets provide essential ecosystem services:
- **Fritillary butterflies**: Sole host plant for caterpillars
- **Native bees**: Important early nectar source
- **Wild turkeys**: Seeds are food source
- **Small mammals**: Shelter and nesting material

### Environmental Benefits

- **Erosion control**: Dense root systems stabilize soil
- **Pollinator support**: Early blooms feed emerging insects
- **Native biodiversity**: Support complex food webs

## Fun Facts About Violets

- Napoleon Bonaparte adopted the violet as his personal emblem, earning the nickname "Corporal Violet"
- Violets can produce up to 100 seeds per plant annually
- The flowers are actually slightly fragrant, but the scent molecules temporarily deaden smell receptors
- Ancient Greeks used violets to moderate anger and induce sleep
- Violet flowers change color with pH—more blue in alkaline soil, more purple in acidic
- Some violet species can live for over 100 years in the wild
