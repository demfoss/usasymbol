## Why Was the Northern Cardinal Chosen?

In 1929, Illinois schoolchildren voted to select the Northern Cardinal as the official state bird. The choice reflected the bird's year-round presence in Illinois, its beautiful appearance, and its cheerful song that brightens even the coldest winter days.

The Northern Cardinal's vibrant red color symbolizes vitality and passion, while its resilience in harsh winters represents the strength and determination of Illinois residents. The bird's widespread popularity and recognition made it an ideal ambassador for the Prairie State.

**Interesting fact:** The Northern Cardinal holds the distinction of being the state bird of more U.S. states than any other bird, shared by seven states in total: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.

## Physical Characteristics

### Male Cardinals

Male Northern Cardinals are instantly recognizable by their **brilliant red plumage** that covers their entire body. They have a distinctive pointed crest on their head, a thick orange-red bill, and a black face mask that surrounds the bill. The intensity of their red coloring can vary based on diet and age.

### Female Cardinals

Female cardinals are more subdued in coloration, featuring warm brownish-tan feathers with reddish tinges on their wings, tail, and crest. They also have the characteristic crest and thick bill, with a grayish face mask. This less conspicuous coloring helps protect them while nesting.

### Juvenile Cardinals

Young cardinals resemble adult females but have a dark bill instead of the bright orange-red bill of adults. Males begin showing red feathers during their first molt in late summer or fall.

## Behavior & Habits

### Song & Calls

The Northern Cardinal is known for its loud, clear whistle that sounds like **"cheer-cheer-cheer"** or **"birdy-birdy-birdy."** Unlike many songbirds, both males and females sing, with females often singing from the nest to communicate with their mate. Cardinals sing year-round, bringing joy to winter landscapes when most other birds are silent.

### Territorial Behavior

Cardinals are highly territorial, especially during breeding season. Males will aggressively defend their territory from other males, sometimes even attacking their own reflection in windows or car mirrors, mistaking it for a rival.

### Feeding Habits

Cardinals are primarily seed-eaters but also consume fruits and insects. They forage on the ground and in shrubs, using their powerful bills to crack seeds. They're common visitors to bird feeders, preferring sunflower seeds, safflower, and cracked corn.

### Mating & Family Life

Cardinals form **monogamous pairs** that often mate for life. Males court females with impressive displays, including feeding them seeds beak-to-beak. The female builds the nest and incubates the eggs, while the male provides food. Both parents feed the young after hatching.

## Habitat & Conservation

### Preferred Habitat

Northern Cardinals thrive in woodland edges, thickets, suburban gardens, and parks. They prefer areas with dense shrubs and small trees that provide cover and nesting sites. In Illinois, they're found throughout the state, from urban Chicago to rural farmlands.

### Conservation Status

The Northern Cardinal is listed as a species of **"Least Concern"** by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their population has actually expanded northward over the past century, likely due to bird feeders providing winter food sources and climate change creating milder winters.

### How to Help Cardinals in Illinois

- Plant native shrubs and trees like dogwood, serviceberry, and viburnum
- Provide bird feeders with sunflower seeds and safflower
- Maintain dense vegetation for nesting and shelter
- Avoid using pesticides that can harm their food sources
- Keep cats indoors to protect nesting birds
